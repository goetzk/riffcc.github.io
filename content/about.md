*"e cinere surgemus" (out of ash, rise)*

Riff.CC is building tools and platforms to empower users to create and share digital content in permanent, resilient digital spaces called Lenses.

## What's a Lens?
A Lens is a decentralized, self-hosted digital space - your personal view of the world - containing media, tools, and content you can share or collaborate on. Lenses can follow others to sync content instantly, enabling seamless, permissionless collaboration.

Private sharing is also planned, letting you control who can follow and access your Lens.

You can learn how to setup a Lens in our [documentation](/docs).

## Join us

Whether you're a developer, creator, librarian, or simply someone who believes in a free and open internet, you can help us build the future of free and libre content.

## Build with us
<p>If you want to learn how you could use Riff.CC's Lens SDK and Flagship technologies to build your own
applications - whether enterprise, open source, or personal - or what we could build for you,</p>

please reach out to us at [team@riff.cc](mailto:team@riff.cc) and we'll meet with you to discuss your needs and how we can help.

Whether you build applications yourself or want us to build them with you, we can help you customise the Lens SDK to suit just about any use case.

Riff.CC is built around several key concepts that define how it operates and interacts with users. These concepts form the foundation of our decentralized streaming service and cooperative library model.

You can read more about specific concepts in the dedicated pages for each.

## Creative Commons

Riff.CC focuses on legally free media content, primarily licensed under Creative Commons. This allows users to share, remix, and build upon existing works while respecting the rights of creators. We also host public domain content, ensuring a wide range of accessible media.

## [Lenses](/docs/concepts/lenses/)

A Lens is an individual instance of Flagship that acts as both a library and a gateway to the broader network. Each Lens can:

- Host its own content collection
- Mirror content from other Lenses
- Participate in the federation network
- Operate independently if needed

Read more about Lenses and how to create your own on the [Lenses](/docs/concepts/lenses/) page.

## [Decentralized Federation (Defederation)](/docs/concepts/defederation/)

Unlike traditional centralized platforms, Flagship uses a federation model where:

- No single point of failure exists
- Content is distributed across multiple nodes
- Each Lens maintains autonomy while sharing resources
- The network becomes stronger with each new participant

We call this Defederation, as Lenses have to explicitly opt in to federate with each other. Read more about it on the [Defederation](/docs/concepts/defederation/) page.

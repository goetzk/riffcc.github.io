A Lens is an individual instance of Flagship that acts as both a library and a gateway to the broader network. Each Lens can:

- Host its own content
- Follow other Lenses
- Be followed by other Lenses

Here's how it works.

## Creating a Lens
Creating your own Lens is simple. It involves downloading and configuring the Flagship software. 

We also provide a Docker setup for getting started quickly.

Visit the [Create a Lens](/docs/flagship/create-lens/) page for detailed instructions.

Once you've created your Lens, you can give other people your Site ID to follow it with.

## Following Lenses
You can also make your Lens follow other Lenses.

Simply copy the Site ID of the Lens you want to follow, and go to the *Admin* section of your Lens, then *Subscriptions*. 

Paste the Site ID of the Lens you want to follow, and click *Subscribe*.

After adding it, you'll see it appear in the list of subscriptions.

Once you've added the subscription, the content of the followed Lens will appear in your Lens.

To unfollow a Lens, simply click the trash icon next to the Lens you want to unfollow.

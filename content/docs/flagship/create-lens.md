We provide a streaming service called Riff.CC that allows users to watch, share, and curate legally free media content.

Our platform is built on decentralized principles, ensuring that content remains accessible and resilient against censorship.

It is the first unstoppable library, allowing anyone to mirror their own library from ours, and share it with others. You can learn more about unstoppable libraries by reading about [Flagship](/docs/flagship).

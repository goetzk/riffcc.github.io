To create your own Lens, you'll need a domain name (a subdomain can work!) and a hosting provider.

The process is simple and takes about 10-30 minutes to complete depending on your comfort level with the command line.

{{< callout type="info"emoji="üåê" >}}
  We plan to offer affordable Lens hosting services later.
  
  We will also be open sourcing software to allow anyone to run their own Lens hosting provider.
{{< /callout >}}

We suggest using Hetzner or DigitalOcean, but just about any provider will work.

You can also self-host your own Lens, but you'll need to be comfortable with the command line and have a basic understanding of how to set up a server.

## Setting up your domain

Point your domain name or subdomain at your server's IP address using an A or AAAA DNS record.

You can check with your hosting provider for information on how to do this, or ask us for help.

### Node.js

You'll need to install Node.js, at least version 22.

We suggest using the [NodeSource installation guide](https://github.com/nodesource/distributions#installation-instructions).

1. Download and import the Nodesource GPG key

```sh
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y ca-certificates curl gnupg
sudo mkdir -p /etc/apt/keyrings
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/gpgkey/nodesource-repo.gpg.key | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/nodesource.gpg
```

2. Add deb repository configuration

```sh
echo "deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/nodesource.gpg] https://deb.nodesource.com/node_22.x nodistro main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/nodesource.list
```

3. Run apt update and install the Node.JS package

```sh
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install nodejs -y
```

4. Download the official pnpm installation script:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://get.pnpm.io/install.sh | sh -
```

2. Source your .bashrc file so your system recognizes pnpm's path properly (or zshrc for Zsh users, etc.):

```sh
source ~/.bashrc
```

### Git

You'll need to install Git. Most systems will come with it already, but if not, you can install it with:

```sh
sudo apt-get install git -y
```

## Installing the Lens Node

Use `pnpm` to install the Lens Node.

```sh
pnpm install -g @riffcc/lens-node
```

If prompted, also run `pnpm approve-builds -g` (selecting 'a' and 'y' when prompted) to allow dependencies to be built properly.

```
wings@blackberry:~$ pnpm approve-builds -g
‚úî Choose which packages to build (Press <space> to select, <a> to toggle all, <i> to invert selection) ¬∑ @ipshipyard/node-datachannel, better-sqlite3, classic-level
‚úî The next packages will now be built: @ipshipyard/node-datachannel, better-sqlite3, classic-level.
Do you approve? (y/N) ¬∑ true
.pnpm/@ipshipyard+node-datachannel@0.26.6/node_modules/@ipshipyard/node-datachannel: Running install script, done in 98ms
.pnpm/better-sqlite3@11.10.0/node_modules/better-sqlite3: Running install script, done in 71ms
.pnpm/classic-level@3.0.0/node_modules/classic-level: Running install script, done in 46ms
```

## Configuring your Lens

1. **Setup your Lens Node:**
    The first step is to initialize your node. This will create a data directory, generate necessary cryptographic identities, and create a configuration file.

    ```bash
    lens-node setup
    ```

    This command will:
    - Create a directory at `~/.lens-node` (or a custom path if specified with `--dir`).
    - If the directory already exists, it will prompt you to confirm reconfiguration.
    - Initialize a Peerbit client and a Lens Site.
    - Save the configuration, including the Lens Site address, to `config.json` within the data directory.
    - Print important details like your Peer ID, Public Key, and Site Address.

    {{< callout emoji="üêâ" >}}
      You may see a warning about "The node directory "/home/$USER/.lens-node" already exists" even if you've never created a Lens before.

      This is a bug in the Lens node, and can be safely ignored when creating a Lens for the *first time*. It will be fixed in a future release.

      Simply answer "Yes" to the prompt, and the setup will continue.
    {{< /callout >}}

    Here's an example of the output:

    ```
    wings@blackberry:~$ lens-node setup
    ‚úî The node directory "/home/wings/.lens-node" already exists. Do you want to reconfigure for setup? This action is irreversible. Yes
    Node directory cleared and ready for new configuration at: /home/wings/.lens-node
    [Site] Access controllers open: 334.832ms
    [Site] Data stores open: 114.121ms
    [Site] Total open time: 449.201ms

    Lens Node setup complete!
    --------------------------------------------------
    Node Directory: /home/wings/.lens-node
    Configuration saved to: /home/wings/.lens-node/config.json
    Peer ID: 12D3KooWAo2AC2Aga6gxon6Fd8jXMoxRtBkQrBBK3hsuQs3wtnNT
    Node Public Key: ed25119p/0e837b3358453b3384ba0a86701e440e79b009fba4f010b0a944f054df21b8c8
    Site Address: zb2rhjCvmPfrgmgjGvnsYLQpzwbLGgvDWs2AsJp5qN4Zxwt7Z
    --------------------------------------------------
    You can now run your node using: lens-node run
    ```

    Save the Site Address, as you'll need it later. (You can always find it in `~/.lens-node/config.json` if you forget.)

2. **Start your Lens Node:**
    To start your node, run:

    ```bash
    lens-node run
    ```

    This will start the node daemon, connect to the Peerbit network, and open your Lens site. An interactive terminal will open, and you can use it to manage your node.

    We suggest running the node in a screen or tmux session, so that it keeps running in the background if you close the terminal.

    Copy the `ws` listening address for later usage - for example, `/ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/8002/ws/p2p/12D3KooWAo2AC2Aga6gxon6Fd8jXMoxRtBkQrBBK3hsuQs3wtnNT`.

## Installing Flagship

1. Clone Flagship's GitHub repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/riffcc/flagship.git
    ```

2. Move into Flagship's directory and set up its installation dependencies:
    ```sh
    cd flagship
    pnpm install
    ```

3. Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env`:
    ```sh
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

4. Edit the `.env` file to set the `VITE_SITE_ADDRESS` variable to the Site Address you saved earlier. Set the `VITE_BOOTSTRAPPERS` variable to the `ws` listening address you copied earlier.

5. Run the application in development mode (with hot reloading):
    ```sh
    pnpm watch:web
    ```

6. Visit the application in your browser at `http://localhost:5175/#/account`.

7. You should now see the Flagship application.

    ![Flagship application](/images/docs/flagship/installing-flagship-account.png)

    {{< callout emoji="üêâ" >}}
      You may safely ignore the "Not implemented" warning at the bottom of the page.
    {{< /callout >}}

8. Click the public key underneath the "Public Key" heading to copy it to your clipboard.

### Follow a Lens (Optional)

One of the best parts of running a Lens is being able to follow other Lenses and see their content.

Simply copy the Site ID of the Lens you want to follow, and go to the *Admin* section of your Lens, then *Subscriptions*. 

Paste the Site ID of the Lens you want to follow, and click *Subscribe*.

{{< callout type="info" emoji="‚ÑπÔ∏è" >}}
The current Riff.CC Lens' Site ID is `zb2rhoGguxQaNZy47DvRPLRmpT84mwvwuvekUhmCgF7nkhTCn`, if you want something to follow.
{{< /callout >}}

![Adding a subscription](/images/docs/concepts/follow-a-lens.png)

After adding it, you'll see it appear in the list of subscriptions.

Once you've added the subscription, the content of the followed Lens will appear in your Lens.

Flagship is the reference implementation of an unstoppable library - a decentralized platform for sharing and preserving digital content that cannot be censored or shut down.

As each Lens can be replicated or mirrored by any number of other Lenses, Flagship provides a self-healing, censorship-resistant way to publish and share. The loss of an individual Lens does not affect the availability of the content it contains, as long as other communities have copies.

It provides a web interface (and later, Electron apps for desktop and mobile) to create, manage, and share your own Lens - an instance of Flagship that can mirror content from other Lenses and participate in the decentralised federation network.

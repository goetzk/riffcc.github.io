Flagship is the reference implementation of an unstoppable library - a decentralized platform for sharing and preserving digital content that cannot be censored or shut down.

It provides a web interface (and later, Electron apps for desktop and mobile) to create, manage, and share your own Lens - an instance of Flagship that can mirror content from other Lenses and participate in the decentralised federation network.

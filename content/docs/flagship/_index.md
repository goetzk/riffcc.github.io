Flagship is our decentralized library platform that allows communities to build and maintain their own unstoppable digital libraries.

It's a proof-of-concept implementation of a decentralized media platform for watching, sharing, distributing, and curating legally free media content.

Built as an Electron application with web deployment capabilities, it combines the user experience of centralized platforms like Netflix and YouTube with the decentralized architecture of peer-to-peer networks.

The software enables users to:

* Upload and share media content (audio, video, books and more)
* Discover content through categorization and featured content systems
* Participate in a federated network of content-sharing nodes
* Self-host instances while maintaining connectivity to the broader network

## System Architecture Overview

Flagship implements a hybrid architecture that can operate both as a desktop Electron application and as a web application, built on a foundation of peer-to-peer networking technologies.

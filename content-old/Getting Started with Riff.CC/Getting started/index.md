# Getting started

Riff.CC is pioneering a transformative approach to digital collaboration through the  innovative Defederation Model. This system enables decentralized, censorship-resistant infrastructures for websites and media, leveraging technologies like OrbitDB and IPFS. By fostering open-source contributions and cooperation, Riff.CC aims to create a more resilient and cost-effective web infrastructure that anyone can join - for many use cases, even at scale, running a Lens will be close to free.

It is compatible with existing moderation and hosting models, as well as enabling alternative models like global co-operatives, grassroots organisations, enterprise collaboration and more.

## The Defederation Model

Defederation (Decentralised federation) is a social model for cooperative development of ideas, platforms and more.

Implemented as part of Orbiter, it provides the foundation for many interesing things.

### Concept and Benefits

The Defederation Model is a cooperative protocol that redefines digital collaboration. It enables websites to operate independently yet interconnect, ensuring data persistence even if individual sites go down. This approach supports a wide range of applications, from media libraries to direct company collaborations.

### Core Technologies & Principles

* **OrbitDB, Constellation and IPFS**: These technologies form the backbone of The Pioneer Ecosystem, allowing for decentralized storage and retrieval of data.
* **Open and Neutral**: The system is built on open-source principles, ensuring that anyone can study, adapt, and contribute to its development.
* **Modular and upgradable**: Each component, even ones as fundamental as OrbitDB and IPFS, can be replaced and upgraded over time as new technologies come out.

## Building a Collaborative Ecosystem

### Lenses and Their Role

Lenses are a unique feature of Riff.CC, allowing users to create websites or platforms by building upon the work of others, or working with them more easily. This modular approach promotes innovation and growth within the ecosystem.

### The Immortal Library

Riff.CC envisions creating "Immortal Libraries"—digital repositories that are impervious to data loss. By leveraging decentralized technologies, these libraries aim to preserve information indefinitely.

## One Pane of Glass

We're already working on making Orbiter modular and able to adapt to just about any use case.

With one pane of glass, you'll be able to not only build your own Lens out of the Orbiter Modules available to you - you'll also be able to import or follow any Lens you have permission to copy from, enabling instant upgrades to collaboration.

## Practical Applications and Use Cases

### Media and Libraries

Riff.CC supports the creation of streaming portals and media libraries, providing a robust foundation for distributing content globally. This is achieved through a combination of IPFS for file distribution and OrbitDB for database management.

### Decentralised Open Source Software Distribution

We're looking at decentralised systems for running software distribution - particularly plugins for open source projects.

You can imagine a world in which a plugin author can request that a Lens, run by a trusted community member, follows their own Lens.

By doing so, the plugin author now allows that community member to distribute their plugin, but thanks to the signatures and keys provided by OrbitDB, not even the Lenses that distribute the plugin can fake releases or tamper with it, as a developer will be the only one with the keys to publish for their package or plugin.

### Enterprise Collaboration

The platform is designed to facilitate seamless collaboration between organisations. By enabling shared databases and decentralised storage, Riff.CC reduces costs and complexity for enterprises of all sizes.

### Custom Anything

With the powerful combination of IPFS, OrbitDB and future technologies like Codex Storage, just about any use case can be built out as an Orbiter Lens.

One day, we're even planning to explore a Defederated app store for the web, allowing many use cases to run along the rails Orbiter already builds.

## The Accretion Model

## Growth Through Collaboration

The Accretion Model describes how Riff.CC's tools (The Pioneer Ecosystem) can grow exponentially more useful and valuable as more users and organizations participate. By adding new modules and use cases, the platform becomes more and more interesting to users and potential collaborators.

### Incentive Alignment

Riff.CC aligns incentives for all participants, promoting cooperation over competition. This creates a positive feedback loop, where collaboration leads to mutual benefits for all involved.

### Easy & Instant

As Lenses can build on top other Lenses, and each new use case builds the strength of Orbiter, deploying a new and useful Lens is easy and quick. We're aiming to have it take less than a minute to spin one up.

Following a Lens you have permission to pull from will instantly pull that entire Lens into your own, including all content and data, without needing to move data yourself.

## The Future of Collaboration

### The Cooperation Engine

Riff.CC's ultimate goal is to build a "Cooperation Engine"—a system that enables seamless collaboration across diverse groups and individuals. By eliminating traditional barriers, this engine fosters innovation and progress.

### Real-World Impact

The potential applications of Riff.CC's technology are vast, spanning industries like healthcare, education, and government. By providing a decentralised, privacy-respecting platform, Riff.CC aims to drive societal change and enhance global collaboration.

Riff.CC represents a bold vision for the future of digital collaboration. By leveraging open-source technologies and innovative protocols, it aims to create an ecosystem where anyone can contribute, collaborate, and thrive. As the platform continues to evolve, it promises to redefine how we work together in the digital age.

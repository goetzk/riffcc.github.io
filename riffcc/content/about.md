## Building Libraries That Last

Riff.CC is a platform dedicated to creating cooperative, unstoppable libraries and platforms that are owned and operated by the users themselves.

We believe in the power of community-driven infrastructure that cannot be shut down, censored, or controlled by any single entity.

## Our Mission

We're building the future of digital libraries and creative platforms through:

- **Decentralized Infrastructure**: Using IPFS and other distributed technologies to ensure content remains accessible forever
- **Community Ownership**: Platforms owned and governed by their users, not corporations
- **Open Source**: All our tools and platforms are open source and freely available
- **Preservation**: Ensuring that human knowledge and creativity are preserved for future generations

## What We Do

### Libraries That Can't Be Stopped

We create resilient digital libraries that exist across thousands of nodes worldwide. When you add content to a Riff.CC library, it becomes part of a permanent, uncensorable record of human creativity and knowledge.

### Platforms By The Users, For The Users

Every platform we build is designed with community governance in mind. Users aren't just consumersâ€”they're owners with a real say in how the platform operates and evolves.

### Tools for Creators

We provide the tools and infrastructure that creators need to share their work freely, maintain control over their content, and connect directly with their audience without intermediaries.

## Our Values

- **Freedom**: Information wants to be free, and we're here to help it
- **Cooperation**: Together we're stronger than any corporation
- **Resilience**: Building systems that can withstand any attempt at control or censorship
- **Accessibility**: Knowledge and creativity should be available to everyone, everywhere
- **Sustainability**: Creating systems that can maintain themselves through community support

## Join Us
